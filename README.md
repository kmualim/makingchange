# Early projects
This repository contains all relevant files for my initial code including projects like : Making Change, Leap Year and Watson-Crick Complement. 

# Project 1 : Making Change 
This method seeks to output the minimum number of coins that can be used to make change. Bills were not accounted for but could be modified to encompass notes. 

# Project 2 : Leap Years 
This method seeks to output if the year is a Leap Year or not. 

# Project 3 : Finding Watson Crick Complements of DNA strands 
This methods seeks to output the Watson-Crick complement of codons.
